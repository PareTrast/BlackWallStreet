            <h2>Let's Keep History From Repeating.</h2>

            <section id="history">
                <p>The Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma is where Black Wall Street was born. The community in Tulsa officially became known as Greenwood in 1906. Greenwood continued to grow and housed thriving businesses including grocery stores, banks,
                    libraries, and much more. Greenwood quickly became one of the most affluent African-American communities in the country. Thus earning its name Black Wall Street.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With an estimated 10,000 plus residents, Greenwood continued to grow and prosper. Many of the white residents began to feel intimidated. Greenwood continued to grow until it's boundaries collided with the boundaries of the white neighborhoods. The white
                    residents began to resent that the black community was better in many regards. This led to many of the white residents spreading hatred, and accusing the black residents of crimes.
                </p>
                <p>An accusation of sexual assault is what ignited the hatred of the white residents. After the accusation, a lynch mob was put together. This lynch mob included nearly 2,000 Ku Klux Klan members looking for "justice". On May 31, 1921 ,within
                    16 hours, 60% of black residents living in Black Wall Street were arrested. The lynch mobs burned the black owned businesses and homes, all while murdering hundreds of Black citizens.</p>
                <p>By today's estimates the damage done amounted to almost $30 million dollars. This massacre was one of the largest massacres of Black citizens in America. It all stemmed from our economic properity and jealousy of others. It was torn down.
                    Now let us build it back up.</p>
                <p>Stronger, Better, Brighter.</p>
